# Project 7: David Chataway
Repository for David Chataway's project 7 work for Harvard CS145.

## Objectives
- Implementing simple policies to the [Project 6](https://github.com/Harvard-CS145/cs145-21-project6-dchataway) CONGA load balancing algorithm.
- Experiment with how different policies impact performance of the network as a whole.

## Overview
For my Project 7, I am pursuing an open-ended topic: designing (what I call) "priority"-based CONGA load balancing, whereby certain flows are given priority over others.
